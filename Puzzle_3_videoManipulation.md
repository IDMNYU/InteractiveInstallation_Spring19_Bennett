# Interactive Installation 

* **DM-GY 4913-B Special Topics: Interactive Installation**

## Puzzle 3: Create a Max patch that loads videos from a given folder. These could be pre-recorded videos or recently recorded videos and plays them. Then manipulate these videos to generate a completely new video piece.

Loading and playing the videos is the first step. Manipulating them opens up entirely different worlds of possibilities. We can control the location of the video on the screen, color, place in timeline, speed, multiplicity and more. We can layer video and create montages. We can splice and mix video.

Building on the prior knowledge of file loading and control, as well as max objects and manipulation, and apply them to video content. I expect to see you explore. Complete the Fundamentals tutorials to get a basic functionality. Then, complete 1 tutorial from each of the three other sections: Color, Mixing, Multiple Videos & Matrix positioning. Incorporate aspects into your working patch. Explore. Experiment.

Make sure to understand matrices (see the jitter tutorials) and passing arguments and attributes. This is fundamental!!!


##### objects to investigate out:

* "jit.matrix"

* "jit.op"

* "jit.brcosa"

* "jit.rota"

* "route"

* "pack"

* "pak"



Check out the following tutorial patches to help you along your way. Combine existing tutorial elements and a several new portions of your own to generate something different. Don't just slap something together. Investigate. Tinker. Explore.

* Basic Fundamentals: Jitter tutorials: 1-4
* Color: Jitter tutorials: 5-7
* Mixing video: Jitter tutorials: 8-10
* Multiple videos & Matrix positioning: 13-15

#### taking it further:

* This could a system to use ones voice to manipulated video.
